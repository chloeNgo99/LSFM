# Business Problem
Without surfing the dial, it’s difficult for potential listeners to find shows and stations they want to listen to.

We wanted a way for listeners to be able to:
Find Radio Shows that match their tastes and schedules
Find Radio Stations that broadcast within the user’s vicinity
# Solution
Our team develop an application that make it easier for users to search for different nearby stations that suit their interests.

Users will be able to:

Select/sort different genres

Select/sort by time of day

Select/sort by day of the week

Search for radio station by callsign

View radio show information (hostname, genres, timeline)

View results within their current radius
